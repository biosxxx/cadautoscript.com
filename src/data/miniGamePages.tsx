        <strong>Operational Directive:</strong> Execute a design review of the schematic. Clear all sectors of the
        millimeter drafting grid without tripping a Non-Conformance Report.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Technical Specs:</strong> High-contrast blueprint UI with ISO-style type; hazards are critical design
        flaws (NCRs); use HOLD markers (flags) based on proximity counts; pass only with 100% clearance and zero NCRs.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Touching a hidden defect triggers immediate rejection and a Critical Failure Report.
