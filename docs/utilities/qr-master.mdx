## What it does
Use your camera, pasted images, or uploads to scan QR codes and common barcodes, then generate your own codes for WiFi, links, or contacts. Keep a local history with import and export so scans stay portable without cloud sync.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need to scan asset tags or barcodes on the fly without installing an app.
- You want to generate WiFi or link QR codes for quick sharing.
- You need a lightweight, offline way to log scans and export them as JSON.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need enterprise-grade inventory features or cloud syncing.
- Lighting or camera quality is too poor for reliable barcode reads.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Camera feed or uploaded image | Live scan or import an image for decoding. |
| Manual payload | Text, URLs, WiFi credentials, or contact details to encode. |
| History import | Load prior scans from JSON if you want continuity across sessions. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decoded scan results | Text | Contents of scanned QR or barcode values. |
| Generated codes | PNG | Downloadable QR or barcode images for sharing. |
| Scan history | JSON | Export of past scans saved locally. |

## How to use
1. Allow camera access or drop an image to scan.
2. Review the decoded data and optionally save it to history.
3. Enter a link, WiFi login, or text to generate a new code.
4. Download the PNG or keep it in history.
5. Export history as JSON when you need a backup.

**Example dataset:** Scan an equipment tag barcode to capture the serial, then generate a WiFi QR for SSID 'Plant-Guest' with its password and export history.
- Expected output: Returns the scanned serial text, a downloadable WiFi QR PNG, and a JSON history entry you can save.

## Accuracy and verification
- Scanning quality depends on your camera focus and lighting.
- All scans stay local; export history if you need to move devices.
- Generated codes follow common QR/barcode specs; verify with a quick test scan before deploying.
- Clearing history removes local data; keep exports if you need an archive.

## FAQ
- **Which formats are supported?** QR plus common barcodes; test a sample if you rely on a specific symbology.
- **Does it work offline?** Yes. Scanning and generation run in the browser.
- **Where is history stored?** In your browser memory until you export or clear it.
- **Can I scan from images instead of the camera?** Yes. Paste or upload an image and the decoder will read it.
- **Can I export scans?** Yes. Export history as JSON for backup or sharing.
