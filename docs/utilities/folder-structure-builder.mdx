## What it does
Lay out a project folder tree, import an existing JSON or ZIP, and export bash or PowerShell scripts that recreate the scaffold. Download a ZIP or JSON preset so teammates can build the same structure without manual clicking.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You are standardizing a project scaffold for your team.
- You need a quick ZIP scaffold for onboarding without running CLI tools.
- You want to share a folder preset across machines or teams.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need to provision servers or complex permissions; this focuses on folder trees.
- Your tree contains thousands of nodes; consider templating with code instead.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Folder and file nodes | Add folders or files inline to design the tree. |
| JSON or ZIP import | Load an existing structure to modify or reuse. |
| Script options | Choose bash or PowerShell export depending on your environment. |
| Preset metadata | Optional labels or notes for the scaffold. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bash script | .sh | Script to recreate the tree on Unix-like systems. |
| PowerShell script | .ps1 | Script to recreate the tree on Windows. |
| ZIP scaffold | ZIP | Empty folders/files zipped for quick handoff. |
| JSON preset | JSON | Reusable preset to import later. |

## How to use
1. Start a new tree or import an existing JSON/ZIP.
2. Add folders and files until the scaffold matches your project template.
3. Pick bash or PowerShell export (or both).
4. Download the script, ZIP, or JSON preset.
5. Run the script in a safe directory to build the structure.

**Example dataset:** Create a scaffold with src/, docs/, tests/, and README.md placeholders; export a PowerShell script and ZIP for the team.
- Expected output: Provides a .ps1 script, a shell script, a ZIP scaffold, and a JSON preset representing the same tree.

## Accuracy and verification
- Scripts create directories when you run them; review paths before executing.
- Special characters may need quoting on different shells; adjust if your environment is strict.
- Large trees are limited by browser memory when exporting a ZIP.
- All generation runs locally; keep presets under version control if needed.

## FAQ
- **Does it modify my drive automatically?** No. It only creates scripts or ZIPs; you run them where you want the tree.
- **Can I share presets?** Yes. Export JSON and commit or email it to your team.
- **Does it run offline?** Yes. Everything happens in the browser.
- **How are special characters handled?** Scripts quote common characters, but review paths if you use unusual naming.
- **Can I import an existing tree?** Yes. Import from JSON or a ZIP scaffold to start from a prior template.
