import UtilityAccessTable from '@site/src/components/Utilities/UtilityAccessTable';

Each calculator below launches the same standalone page machinists already use. Docs stay nearby, but the apps themselves run in Chromium with WebGL/WASM acceleration.

## Versioning & telemetry

- Utilities are static builds under static/utilities/*. Update the React/Vite project, drop the bundle here, commit, and push.
- Include a concise changelog in the docs whenever a calculator or macro changes behavior.
- Use browser devtools or custom logging endpoints if you need telemetry—nothing tracks usage by default.

## Embed utilities inside docs

See [Embedding calculators](./embed-calculators.md) for iframe snippets and React wrappers. MDX lets you import components or iframes directly, so you can keep instructions and UI together.
