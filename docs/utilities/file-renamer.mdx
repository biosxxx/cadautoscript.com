## What it does
Upload a stack of files, preview new names with regex or literal find/replace, add prefixes, suffixes, or numbering, and download the renamed set as a ZIP. Everything runs in the browser so your files stay local.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need to normalize drawing names or add job numbers before sending a package.
- You want to bulk apply numbering or prefixes without scripting.
- You prefer to keep renaming offline with a quick ZIP output.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need to rename thousands of files on disk; use a CLI script instead.
- You must retain folder hierarchy from nested directories; flattening may not be desired.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Files to rename | Drop the files you want to process. |
| Find/replace rules | Use literal or regex patterns to transform names. |
| Prefix/suffix | Add job numbers, revs, or other tags. |
| Numbering | Set start, increment, and padding for sequence numbers. |
| Casing options | Optional upper/lower/kebab conversions. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preview table | On-screen | See old vs. new names before exporting. |
| Renamed files | ZIP | Downloadable archive with updated filenames. |

## How to use
1. Drop the files to rename.
2. Apply find/replace, prefixes, suffixes, or numbering.
3. Review the preview to confirm collisions are handled.
4. Download the ZIP of renamed files.
5. Share or archive the renamed package.

**Example dataset:** Upload P-001.pdf, P-002.pdf; find 'P-' and replace with 'FAB-', add prefix 2025_, start numbering at 10.
- Expected output: Downloads a ZIP with files named 2025_FAB-10.pdf and 2025_FAB-11.pdf.

## Accuracy and verification
- Renaming happens in the browser; keep originals until you verify the ZIP.
- Regex patterns are powerful—test on a small set first.
- Name collisions are handled in the preview; resolve them before export.
- Large batches are limited by browser memory; split them if needed.

## FAQ
- **Do regex patterns work?** Yes. Use standard JavaScript regex for advanced renames.
- **Is folder structure preserved?** Files are flattened into a ZIP with new names.
- **Is data uploaded?** No. Everything runs locally.
- **How many files can I rename?** Depends on browser memory; split very large sets.
- **What about file contents?** Contents stay unchanged; only names are updated.
