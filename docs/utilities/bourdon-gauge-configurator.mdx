## What it does
Select dial size, pressure range, connection standard, case fill, and accessories for a Bourdon tube pressure gauge. Preview the gauge drawing, toggle siphon or valve options, and export a PDF datasheet with your selections.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You are preparing a pressure gauge spec for a quote or for internal approval.
- You need to compare connection or fill options quickly with a live preview.
- You want a PDF sheet to send to vendors without waiting on a CAD request.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need certified pressure ratings or approvals beyond a preliminary datasheet.
- You are configuring electronic transmitters or diaphragm seals (not covered here).

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dial size | Nominal diameter for the gauge face. |
| Pressure range and units | Select preset spans or enter a custom range. |
| Connection location and standard | Lower/back mount with DIN, ANSI, NPT, or other options. |
| Case fill and window | Dry or filled cases plus window material. |
| Accessories | Siphon, valve, flange, or other options to include. |
| Project metadata | Tag, line number, and notes for the datasheet. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF datasheet | PDF | Gauge summary with preview and selections. |
| Gauge preview | On-screen | Live drawing that updates as you change options. |

## How to use
1. Choose dial size and pressure range (preset or custom).
2. Pick connection location, standard, and case fill.
3. Toggle accessories such as siphon, valve, or flange.
4. Add project tags or notes.
5. Export the PDF datasheet for review or submittal.

**Example dataset:** Dial: 100 mm, Range: 0 to 10 bar, Connection: back mount G 1/2, Case fill: glycerin, Accessory: siphon, Tag: PG-204.
- Expected output: Creates a PDF datasheet with the selected range, connection, fill, accessory, and preview image for PG-204.

## Accuracy and verification
- Datasheet is preliminary; verify pressure ratings and wetted materials with the manufacturer.
- Ranges and units are user-entered; confirm they match your process limits.
- Accessories are indicative; check thread engagement and mounting clearances before install.
- All calculations stay local; save the PDF to archive your selections.

## FAQ
- **Can I enter a custom range?** Yes. Use custom span when presets do not match your need.
- **Does it support imperial units?** Yes. Enter psi or bar as needed; the datasheet reports what you enter.
- **Can I add my company logo?** Use the exported PDF and add branding downstream if required.
- **Is the preview to scale?** It is illustrative; request certified drawings for exact dimensions.
- **Does it upload my data?** No. Everything runs in the browser.
