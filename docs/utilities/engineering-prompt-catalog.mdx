# Engineering Prompt Catalog

Browse a curated library of prompt templates for I&C, mechanical design, and procurement work.

<a className="button button--primary" href="/utilities/engineering-prompt-catalog/" data-nobrokenlinkcheck>Open utility</a>

## What it does
- Groups prompts by discipline and subcategory for quick filtering.
- Highlights placeholders so you can swap real values in seconds.
- Copies prompts to the clipboard or downloads them as Markdown.
- Uses an at-a-glance chart to jump between major categories.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need a fast, consistent prompt structure for technical tasks.
- You want to standardize how your team asks for specs, calculations, or RFQs.
- You need a quick prompt template without opening a doc library.

**Avoid it when:**
- The work requires proprietary data that should not be placed in AI tools.
- You need full project context or data extraction from drawings.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Category filter | Pick I&C, Mechanical, or Procurement to narrow results. |
| Subcategory filter | Drill into areas like Valve Sizing, SolidWorks, or RFQ. |
| Search | Find prompts by keywords in the goal or body text. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt cards | On-screen | Ready-to-copy templates with placeholders. |
| Clipboard copy | Plain text | One click copies the full prompt. |
| Markdown file | .md | Downloaded file uses the prompt title as the filename. |

## How to use
1. Open the utility and choose a discipline in the sidebar.
2. Select a subcategory or type a keyword in the search bar.
3. Click **Copy** to use the prompt, or **Save MD** to download it.
4. Replace bracketed placeholders with project-specific values.

**Example:** Filter **I&C Engineer → Valve Sizing**, copy the Cv calculation prompt, replace `[P1]`, `[P2]`, and `[Q]`, then paste into your AI tool.

## Accuracy and verification
- Prompts are templates only. Always verify outputs against your standards and calculations.
- Remove confidential data before pasting prompts into any external system.
- Keep unit systems consistent when filling in placeholders.

## FAQ
- **Does it run offline?** Yes. The prompt library is embedded and runs fully in the browser.
- **Can I add my own prompts?** Not yet. This catalog is a fixed starter set.
- **Will it store or upload my data?** No. Copying and downloads happen locally.
- **Why are placeholders in brackets?** They are easy to scan and replace before use.
