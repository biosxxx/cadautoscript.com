## What it does
Select process connections, chamber dimensions, vent and drain options, and materials, then preview a live SVG sketch. Export a PDF datasheet that captures the selections for procurement or vendor review.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You are drafting a magnetic level gauge specification for a quote or internal review.
- You want to verify center-to-center dimensions and connection standards before ordering.
- You need a quick datasheet PDF to share with piping or instrumentation teams.

**Avoid it when:**
- You require certified pressure or float sizing calculations from a manufacturer.
- You are configuring guided wave radar or non-magnetic level instruments.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Process connection standard and size | DIN, ANSI, weld, or threaded options for side connections. |
| Center-to-center dimension | Gauge chamber length used to scale the sketch. |
| Top and bottom connections | Vent and drain options such as plug, valve, or flange. |
| Materials and ratings | Chamber material, flange rating, and specific gravity assumptions. |
| Instrumentation options | Switches, remote transmitters, heating jackets, and indicator preferences. |
| Project metadata | Tag, line number, customer, and notes for the datasheet. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF datasheet | PDF | Technical sheet with selections and a scaled sketch. |
| Live SVG preview | SVG | On-screen sketch updating with your inputs. |
| Connection summary | On-screen | Process, vent, and drain callouts for review. |

## How to use
1. Choose the process connection standard, size, and rating.
2. Enter center-to-center length plus vent and drain details.
3. Set materials, specific gravity, and optional switches or transmitters.
4. Add project metadata for traceability.
5. Review the sketch and export the PDF datasheet.

**Example dataset:** Side connections: DIN DN25 PN40 RF, Center-to-center: 1800 mm, Top: 1/2 in NPT plug, Bottom: 1/2 in NPT valve, Material: 316L, Options: top and bottom sensors on, Heating jacket off, Tag: MLG-101.
- Expected output: Generates a PDF datasheet with the selected connections, dimensions, materials, and a live sketch for MLG-101.

## Accuracy and verification
- Sketch dimensions are illustrative; confirm final dimensions with the vendor before fabrication.
- Pressure and temperature ratings must be validated against your design code.
- Specific gravity and float sizing are assumed; confirm with process data if critical.
- Files stay local until you download the PDF.

## FAQ
- **Can I switch between metric and imperial?** Yes. Enter values in the units you use; the sketch scales accordingly.
- **Is the PDF ready for submittal?** It is a preliminary datasheet; obtain vendor confirmation for certified drawings.
- **Does it store my tags?** No. Close the page to clear entries or save the PDF for your records.
- **Can I adjust vent and drain types?** Yes. Pick plug, valve, or flange styles for top and bottom.
- **Is any data sent to a server?** No. Calculations and export run in the browser.
