## What it does
Pipe Cutter Visualizer renders pipe-to-pipe intersections in 3D so you can check the saddle fit before cutting. Enter run and branch diameters, tweak the intersection angle and offset, and download true-scale DXF wraps for the branch along with a matching cutout for the run pipe.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You know the run and branch diameters and need a wrap template for torch, plasma, or waterjet cutting.
- You want to preview clearance and offset before welding spool pieces.
- You need quick DXF geometry to drop into CAM or to print at 1:1 for the shop.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need reinforcement pad sizing or code calculations; this tool focuses on geometry only.
- The pipe is heavily ovalized or requires complex bevel allowances beyond simple offsets.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Run pipe outside diameter (D1) | Base cylinder the saddle wraps around; note schedule or wall separately if needed. |
| Branch pipe outside diameter (D2) | Branch tube that will be notched and wrapped. |
| Intersection angle | Angle between run and branch centerlines; supports perpendicular or skewed joints. |
| Branch offset | Shift the saddle up or down to match real-world offsets before cutting. |
| Padding / trim allowance | Extra margin added to the DXF output so prints have bleed room for cutting. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Branch wrap template | DXF | Unrolled saddle for wrapping the branch pipe at 1:1 scale. |
| Run-pipe cutout | DXF | Open polyline showing the hole to cut in the run pipe, with a reference box. |
| 3D preview | Viewport | Interactive view for checking alignment before exporting geometry. |

## How to use
1. Open the utility and enter diameters in the unit system you work with.
2. Enter the run pipe OD, branch OD, and intersection angle.
3. Add any offset or padding needed for your fit-up.
4. Review the live 3D preview to confirm clearance and rotation.
5. Export the DXF wrap and hole template, then print or send to CAM.

**Example dataset:** Run pipe OD: 114.3 mm, Branch OD: 60.3 mm, Angle: 45 deg, Offset: 10 mm, Padding: 5 mm.
- Expected output: Exports pipe_template.dxf and hole_template.dxf sized for a 1:1 print or CAM import.

## Accuracy and verification
- Assumes round pipes with negligible ovality; check against actual stock.
- DXF export is geometric only; add bevel gaps or weld preps in the shop program if needed.
- Print at 100% scaling and verify a quick paper wrap before committing to steel.
- Pressure or reinforcement checks must be done separately.

## FAQ
- **Can I work in inch and metric?** Yes. Enter values in the units you use as long as you keep inputs consistent; the DXF follows your numbers.
- **Are the DXF templates true scale?** Yes. The exports are generated at 1:1. Disable any print scaling when plotting.
- **Can I tweak bevel allowance or root gap?** Use the padding or offset controls to leave extra material, then finish the bevel in CAM or at the bench.
- **Does it run offline?** Yes. The calculation and DXF export run in the browser and stay on your device.
- **Which CAD tools open the DXF?** Any DXF-capable tool (AutoCAD, Fusion, SheetCAM, etc.) can import the polylines.
