## What it does
Drop CAD-generated PDFs, auto-detect header rows and columns, trim revision or footer noise, and export per-file CSVs or a merged master report. Everything runs client-side so drawings and extracted data stay on your device.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You want to pull BOM tables out of drawing PDFs without manual retyping.
- You need a quick CSV export to hand to procurement or QA.
- You prefer local parsing with no uploads.

**Avoid it when:**
- Your PDFs are scanned images that would need OCR to be read.
- Tables have heavy merged cells or variable column counts that break auto-detection.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PDF drawings | Vector PDFs with BOM or spec tables. |
| Header row selection | Confirm or adjust which row defines the column headers. |
| Auto column detection toggles | Control how the parser groups columns. |
| Row filters | Skip revision or footer rows you do not want in the CSV. |
| Master report option | Combine outputs into one CSV when needed. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-file CSV | CSV | One CSV for each PDF you process. |
| Master CSV | CSV | Optional combined report across all uploaded files. |
| Preview table | On-screen | Review and tweak before downloading. |

## How to use
1. Upload one or more drawing PDFs.
2. Confirm the detected header row and adjust columns if needed.
3. Trim any footer or revision rows.
4. Download per-file CSVs or a master report.
5. Archive the CSVs with your job packet.

**Example dataset:** Upload two assembly PDFs with BOM tables, keep header row 2, trim revision notes, and export both per-file CSVs and a master_report.csv.
- Expected output: Produces two individual CSVs plus a combined master file with aligned columns.

## Accuracy and verification
- Relies on selectable text; scanned PDFs need OCR first.
- Merged or irregular tables may need manual cleanup after export.
- Review the preview before downloading to ensure the correct header row was detected.
- All parsing runs locally; keep your own backups of exported CSVs.

## FAQ
- **Does it OCR images?** No. It reads vector text only.
- **Can I process many files?** Yes. Upload a batch and export per-file or as a master report.
- **Is any data uploaded?** No. Everything stays in the browser.
- **How are merged cells handled?** The parser flattens columns; double-check and adjust after export if needed.
- **Can I change the delimiter?** Exports as CSV; adjust delimiters later in your spreadsheet tool.
