# WebSTEP Viewer

Load STEP assemblies, inspect parts, and measure geometry directly in the browser.

<a className="button button--primary" href="/utilities/webstep-viewer/" data-nobrokenlinkcheck>Open utility</a>

## What it does
- Parses .step / .stp files locally with WebAssembly.
- Builds an assembly tree so you can isolate or hide parts.
- Measures distances, radii, and angles on geometry.
- Exports a simple BOM (CSV) from the assembly structure.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need a quick visual check of a STEP file before sending it downstream.
- You want to isolate a part or verify assembly structure.
- You need quick measurements without opening full CAD.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need to edit or heal geometry.
- The model is extremely large and you need full workstation performance.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| STEP file | Upload a .step or .stp assembly. |
| View toggles | Control edges, grid, and view mode. |
| Measurement mode | Pick point, edge, face, or angle probes. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On-screen viewer | UI | Inspect the model and isolate parts. |
| Measurement readouts | On-screen | Shows values in selected units. |
| BOM export | CSV | Basic assembly list from the tree. |

## How to use
1. Drag and drop a .step or .stp file.
2. Use the assembly tree to expand, isolate, or hide components.
3. Toggle measurement or geometry analysis tools as needed.
4. Export the BOM if you need a parts list.

**Example:** Open an equipment assembly, isolate the nozzle sub-assembly, measure the nozzle center-to-center distance, and export a BOM for QA notes.

## Accuracy and verification
- Measurements are based on the model data; verify units and tolerances against your source CAD.
- Large assemblies may take longer to parse and render.
- Files are processed locally and do not upload to a server.

## FAQ
- **Which formats are supported?** STEP files (.step / .stp).
- **Does it upload my files?** No. Everything runs in your browser.
- **Can I edit geometry?** No, this is a viewer and inspector only.
- **Can I export to other formats?** The tool exports CSV BOM only.
- **Why is it slow on big assemblies?** WebAssembly parsing and rendering can be heavy for large models.
