## What it does
Create QR-enabled equipment tags with adjustable materials, engraving depths, and metadata lines. Preview the plate in 3D, tweak dimensions and branding layers, and export high-resolution PNG or SVG artwork for laser marking or UV printing.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need a fast way to generate serialized tags for equipment or tooling.
- You want to hand vector-ready artwork to a printer or engraving shop.
- You are validating QR readability at different sizes before committing to a production run.

**Avoid it when:**
- You require database-backed serialization or production tracking.
- You need direct-to-printer drivers or layout imposition for mass printing.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QR payload | URL, asset ID, or text encoded in the QR. |
| Tag metadata | Asset name, serial, warnings, or other overlay text. |
| Plate size and thickness | Overall dimensions plus engraving depth presets. |
| Material or finish preset | Visual style for stainless, aluminum, plastic, or painted plates. |
| Layout settings | QR size, margins, and typography for the printed plate. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nameplate artwork | PNG/SVG | High-resolution export for engraving or printing. |
| 3D preview | Viewport | Visual check of plate proportions and engraving depth. |

## How to use
1. Enter the QR payload and metadata you want on the tag.
2. Set plate dimensions, margins, and engraving depth.
3. Choose a material or finish preset.
4. Review the 3D preview and adjust sizing if needed.
5. Export PNG or SVG artwork for production.

**Example dataset:** Asset tag P-101 with QR pointing to https://cadautoscript.com/utilities/qr-nameplate/, 100 x 40 mm stainless look, engraving depth 0.3 mm.
- Expected output: Exports a PNG and SVG of the tag plus a preview that shows proportions and readable QR margins.

## Accuracy and verification
- Ensure exported PNG/SVG resolution fits your printer or engraver requirements.
- Leave a quiet zone around the QR for reliable scanning.
- Test one printed sample before running a full batch to confirm readability.
- All rendering runs locally; keep a copy of exports for traceability.

## FAQ
- **Can I change materials?** Yes. Pick a preset to visualize stainless, painted, or plastic plates.
- **Is the QR vector or raster?** SVG exports are vector; PNG is high-resolution raster.
- **Does it work offline?** Yes. Artwork generation happens in the browser.
- **How do I keep the QR scannable?** Maintain a quiet zone and avoid shrinking the code below your scanner's limits.
- **Can I serialize many tags at once?** Use the generator per tag and reuse your payload template.
