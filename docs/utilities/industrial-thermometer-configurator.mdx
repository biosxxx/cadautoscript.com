## What it does
Configure a bimetal industrial thermometer: pick dial size, temperature range, stem length and diameter, mounting design, and thermowell options. Preview the SVG sketch and export a PDF datasheet with project metadata for submittals.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You are building an instrumentation package and need a quick thermometer datasheet.
- You want to verify stem length, connection, and thermowell options before ordering.
- You need a printable PDF to share with vendors or maintenance teams.

**Avoid it when:**
- You require certified pressure or vibration calculations beyond a preliminary datasheet.
- You are specifying electronic RTDs or transmitters instead of bimetal thermometers.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dial nominal size and unit | Select 63, 100, or 160 mm and choose Celsius or Fahrenheit ranges. |
| Temperature range | Preset spans or custom min/max to match process conditions. |
| Stem length, diameter, and material | Pick stem geometry and material for immersion requirements. |
| Connection location, design, and standard | Lower, back, or adjustable mounting with G, NPT, or metric threads. |
| Case material and fill | Dry or silicone-filled cases plus window selection. |
| Thermowell options | Enable solid or fabricated wells, choose design, material, process connection, insertion, and extension lengths. |
| Project metadata and accessories | Tag number, medium, standard, certificates, and options like red pointer or calibration cert. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PDF datasheet | PDF | Generated locally with the configured selections and sketch. |
| SVG preview | On-screen | Live drawing that updates as you change geometry. |
| Configuration summary | On-screen | Quick review of range, stem, connection, and thermowell choices. |

## How to use
1. Select dial size and temperature range (preset or custom).
2. Set stem length, diameter, and material to match immersion needs.
3. Pick connection location and thread standard; choose case fill and window.
4. Enable and size a thermowell if required, then add project metadata.
5. Review the preview and export the PDF datasheet.

**Example dataset:** Dial: 100 mm, Range: 0 to 200 C, Stem: 8 x 200 mm stainless, Mounting: lower G 1/2, Case: silicone filled, Thermowell: solid machined G 1/2 with 200 mm insertion, Tag: TI-310.
- Expected output: Outputs a PDF datasheet and preview for TI-310 showing the selected range, stem, mounting, and thermowell.

## Accuracy and verification
- Datasheet is preliminary; confirm pressure limits and immersion rules with the manufacturer.
- Ensure sufficient insertion length for accurate sensing and to protect the element.
- Units and ranges reflect your input; double-check before issuing a PO.
- All processing stays local until you save the PDF.

## FAQ
- **Can I set a custom range?** Yes. Switch to custom and enter your min and max.
- **Does it support Fahrenheit?** Yes. Choose the unit before selecting a range.
- **Can I run it offline?** Yes. Rendering and PDF export happen in the browser.
- **Does it size thermowells automatically?** It follows your entries; verify against pressure and immersion requirements.
- **Where is my data stored?** Only in your browser until you export the PDF.
