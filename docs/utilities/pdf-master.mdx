## What it does
Drag and drop multiple PDFs, reorder or rotate pages, and export a clean merged package entirely in the browser. Use it to tidy drawing sets or review packs without sending files to a cloud service.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need to reorder or rotate pages in a drawing package before release.
- You want to merge multiple PDFs into one without installing desktop tools.
- You prefer local processing for sensitive drawings.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need to edit text, redact content, or apply signatures (use PDF Batch Signer for stamps).
- Your files are extremely large and better handled by a dedicated desktop PDF editor.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PDF files | Drop one or many PDFs to combine. |
| Page order | Drag to reorder pages or entire files. |
| Page rotation | Rotate misoriented sheets before export. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merged PDF | PDF | Combined and rotated pages in a single download. |
| On-screen preview | Preview | Confirm order before exporting. |

## How to use
1. Drop the PDFs you want to combine.
2. Reorder pages and rotate any misaligned sheets.
3. Review the preview to ensure order is correct.
4. Export the merged PDF.
5. Share or archive the single, cleaned file.

**Example dataset:** Combine GA.pdf and details.pdf, rotate page 2 left, and export one merged drawing set.
- Expected output: Produces a single PDF with corrected orientation and page order ready for release.

## Accuracy and verification
- Processing stays local; keep a backup of the originals in case you need to revert.
- Large files depend on browser memory; split batches if needed.
- Rotation and order changes do not alter content fidelity.
- Verify the merged file before distributing to the shop.

## FAQ
- **Does it compress or change quality?** No intentional compression is applied; output mirrors the source pages.
- **Can I delete pages?** Reorder and rotate are primary actions; export only the pages you include.
- **Is any data uploaded?** No. Merging runs locally in your browser.
- **What file size can it handle?** Depends on your browser memory; split very large sets into smaller batches.
- **Can I sign documents here?** Use PDF Batch Signer for stamping; PDF Master focuses on ordering.
