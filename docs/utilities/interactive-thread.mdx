## What it does
Search ISO, UNC, and UNF threads, then copy callouts or drill diameters straight into your drawing. The tables stay filterable in-browser so you can bounce between coarse, fine, or custom pitch values without flipping through a PDF handbook.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You need a fast tap drill or clearance drill reference for a drawing or setup sheet.
- You want to copy a properly formatted callout into CAD without retyping.
- You are comparing metric and imperial series to pick a substitute size.

**Avoid it when:**
- You need tapered pipe threads, trapezoidal threads, or non-standard forms.
- You require tolerance class calculations beyond the provided reference values.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Thread series | Pick ISO, UNC, or UNF to filter the table. |
| Nominal size | Select the diameter or gauge you need to drill or tap. |
| Pitch or TPI | Choose coarse, fine, or a specific pitch within the series. |
| Tolerance class | Reference fit such as 6H/6g or class 2; use to mirror drawing intent. |
| Drill preference | Toggle between tap drill and clearance drill references. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tap drill diameter | Numeric | Recommended drill size for the selected thread. |
| Major/minor/pitch diameters | Numeric | Reference dimensions for QA and callouts. |
| Formatted callout | Text | Copy-ready string to paste into CAD or travelers. |

## How to use
1. Pick the thread series and filter for the nominal size you need.
2. Select the pitch and tolerance class.
3. Switch to tap or clearance drill to see the right diameter.
4. Copy the callout or drill size straight into your drawing.
5. Optional: flip between metric and imperial lists to compare substitutes.

**Example dataset:** Thread: M12 x 1.75, Tolerance: 6H, Drill: tap drill.
- Expected output: Returns a tap drill recommendation (10.2 mm) and a callout string formatted as M12x1.75-6H.

## Accuracy and verification
- Values follow common ISO and UNC/UNF reference tables; verify against your governing standard.
- Does not cover tapered pipe threads or specialty forms.
- Always validate drill sizes against tool availability and material before cutting.
- For critical fits, confirm tolerances with the official standard or gauge blocks.

## FAQ
- **Can I add custom rows?** Not yet. Use the provided series; paste results where needed.
- **Are pipe threads included?** No. The current set covers ISO, UNC, and UNF only.
- **Does it run offline?** Yes. The tables load locally in your browser.
- **Can I copy values into CAD?** Yes. Copy the callout or drill size directly from the table.
- **Does it show both metric and imperial?** Yes. Switch series to move between ISO and UNC/UNF lists.
