## What it does

- Builds square or triangular pitch patterns inside a circular tube sheet
- Shows a live 2D preview with optional pass partitions
- Exports DXF for 2D layouts and STEP for 3D solids

## Inputs you control

- Tube sheet diameter, thickness, and edge margin
- Tube diameter, pitch, and layout pattern
- Pass count, partition width, and orientation (visual guide)

## Output notes

- DXF export includes the tube sheet outline and all tube holes.
- STEP export runs on WebAssembly in the browser; large hole counts may take longer.
