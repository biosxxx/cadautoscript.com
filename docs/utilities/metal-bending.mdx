## What it does
Experiment with K-factors, bend deductions, and neutral axis positions before sending programs to the press brake. Enter thickness, radius, and angles to see total flat length and per-bend allowances that align with ISO 2768 or ANSI style tolerance blocks.

## When to use it (and when not to)
**Use it when:**
- You are drafting or revising press brake programs and want to validate allowances before production.
- You want to tune K-factor or bend deductions to match a new material batch or brake tooling.
- You need a quick training aid for apprentices learning how flange lengths change with different radii.

**Avoid it when:**
- You are modeling stamped, roll-formed, or highly non-linear bends that need FEA or vendor data.
- You need automatic flat patterns for complex multi-bend parts; run this per bend and combine the results.

## Inputs and outputs
### Inputs
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Material thickness | Gauge or thickness of the sheet you are bending. |
| Inside bend radius | Radius at the neutral axis region; drives allowance values. |
| Bend angle | Formed angle after springback; enter consistent units. |
| Flange lengths | Leg lengths adjacent to the bend that roll into the flat length. |
| K-factor or bend deduction | Choose to drive calculations with K-factor or a known deduction. |
| Material or tooling notes | Optional notes to remind you of die width, grain direction, or brake setup. |

### Outputs
| Output | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total flat length | Numeric | Length to program or cut before forming. |
| Bend allowance / deduction | Numeric | Computed from thickness, radius, and angle for the specified K-factor. |
| Neutral axis location | Numeric | Position expressed as a factor of thickness for reference. |
| Summary card | On-screen | Values to copy into CAM notes or travelers. |

## How to use
1. Enter sheet thickness and inside bend radius.
2. Set the bend angle and flange lengths that need flattening.
3. Choose whether to drive the math from a K-factor or a bend deduction.
4. Review the resulting flat length and allowance numbers.
5. Copy the values into your CAM program or save a screenshot for the router.

**Example dataset:** Thickness: 3 mm, Inside radius: 4 mm, Bend angle: 90 deg, Flanges: 50 mm and 75 mm, K-factor: 0.38.
- Expected output: Shows flat length and bend allowance for the two-leg bend so you can program the brake or CAM flat pattern.

## Accuracy and verification
- Assumes air bending with a single K-factor across the bend.
- Does not account for grain direction or tooling wear; verify with a bent coupon before a full run.
- Keep your input units consistent; the tool does not convert mixed values.
- Use press brake test pieces to refine K-factor for each material lot.

## FAQ
- **Does it support multiple bends?** Use it per bend or per leg; combine the results for complex parts.
- **Can I work in inch and metric?** Yes. Enter values in the units you use; the math is unit-agnostic.
- **How do I export the numbers?** Copy them directly from the summary or take a quick screenshot.
- **Does it run offline?** Yes. Everything runs locally in your browser.
- **What if my brake uses bend deduction tables?** Select bend deduction mode and plug in the table value to see the resulting flat length.
